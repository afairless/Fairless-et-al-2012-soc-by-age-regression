This script executes regression analyses for Fairless et al 2012
Fairless et al 2012, doi: 10.1016/j.bbr.2011.12.001, PMID:  22178318, PMCID:  PMC3474345

The fictional data in "altereddata.txt" were modified from the original 
empirical data used in Fairless et al 2012.
I am using fictional data instead of the original data because I do not have 
permission of my co-authors to release the data into the public domain.  
NOTE:  Because these data are fictional, several important characteristics of
these data may be different from those of the original data.

Each row is a separate mouse.
The left-most 3 columns are quasi-independent variables (mouse strain, sex, and age).
The right-most 5 columns are dependent variables describing behaviors of the
mice during the Social Approach/Choice Test.
